## Overview

This cheat is designed as a **toggle-based gameplay manipulation tool** for Windows, offering real-time control over combat, progression, and exploration systems. Unlike rigid one-click hacks, it emphasizes *adjustability*—sliders, switches, and profiles that let you fine-tune rather than dominate.

Core philosophy:

* Control over chaos
* Reversibility over permanence
* Flow over brute force

Whether you’re testing builds, accelerating progression, or simply easing long sessions, the cheat adapts to your intent.

## ⚡ Setup & Usage

A clean ritual, every time:

1. Launch *The Blood of Dawnwalker*
2. Run the Cheat Tool as Administrator

5. Save your profile once stable

Example configuration:

```ini
[Cheats]
GodMode=true
DamageMultiplier=2.5
InfiniteStamina=true
